    "In pyFAI there are three geometries that are of interest.  The best way to think about them are as two concentric spheres with a real detector at the apex of one sphere and an imaginary detector at the apex of the other sphere. This gives rise to two corrections that are applied to the data. \n",
    "\n",
    "1- correctSolidAngle: This is to correct for a sphere being projected onto a flat detector.  It takes and makes pixel values farther from the center more intense to account for their lower intensity.\n",
    "2- Ewald Sphere Correction: This takes into account the change in intensity for dealing with the ewald sphere as well as the distorition in the spacing.  \n",
    "\n",
    "What connects these two spheres is that their solid angles are equal, which gives rise to the 2th_deg and 2th_rad formalisim.  By their nature these two ignore the ewald \n",

    "\n",
    "To simplify things when pyXEM deals with this integration we assume a flat detector and constant radius of one sphere and then just change the pixel size of the detector to\n",

Then that pixel size is used consistantly assuming a constant.  This is mostly correct, and largely what we do in the first case expect we use that calibration to define one point on the Ewald sphere and then calculate the scale from there. "
